You copy header files from include folder that you created into install/include

After you do do "make" inside build folder,you will create your library inside
the build folder
Then copy the library inside build folder into intall/lib


You don't want to copy your source code into your install file

You give people your libraries and header file which is located in the install folder

To compile: go to particalViewer, type make
